# Social-Profile-Landing-Page
Created this page using just html, CSS and JavaScript. The leftmost panel has links to navigate to other parts of the application. The sections in the center show sample posts on the userâ€™s home page and some of the other people in the circle. The user should be able to add comments to these posts and save these comments in local storage.
